# T4T Task Management Platform - User Manual

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to T4T, a powerful and flexible task management platform designed to automate and schedule your recurring tasks. This guide will walk you through the main features and help you get started.

## 2. Interface Overview

The main window is composed of several key areas:

- **Task List (Left Panel):** Displays all your configured tasks. You can select a task here to view its details.
- **Detail Area (Right Panel):** A tabbed interface where you can view and edit task configurations, see task output, manage application settings, and view logs.
- **Toolbar (Top):** Provides quick access to common actions like adding, starting, pausing, and stopping tasks.
- **Status Bar (Bottom):** Shows a summary of total/running tasks and system resource usage (CPU/Memory).

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Task Management

- **Add Task:** Click the `+` icon in the toolbar to open the "New Task" tab. Here you can define a new task by selecting a module template and configuring it.
- **Start/Pause/Stop Task:** Select a task from the list and use the `Play`, `Pause`, and `Stop` buttons in the toolbar to control its execution.
- **Start/Pause/Stop All Tasks:** Use the corresponding "All" buttons to control all tasks at once.
- **Delete Task:** Right-click a task in the list and select "Delete" from the context menu.

### 3.2. Task Configuration

When you select a task, its details open in a new tab. Here you can find:

- **Config Tab:** A user-friendly editor to modify the task's `config.json` file. Changes are saved automatically.
- **Output Tab:** Displays real-time logs and output generated by the running task.
- **State Tab:** Shows the task's current state, including its schedule, next run time, and status.

### 3.3. Log Viewer

Click the "Logs" icon in the toolbar to open the Log Viewer tab. This shows application-level logs, which are useful for debugging and monitoring the overall health of the platform.

### 3.4. Settings

Click the "Settings" (cogs) icon in the toolbar to open the Settings tab. Here you can:

- **Change Theme:** Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Change Language:** Change the application's display language.

## 4. Module System

T4T uses a modular architecture. Each task is an instance of a "module". Modules are templates that define what a task does. You can find available modules in the `modules` directory of the application.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Task not running:** Check the "Output" tab for the specific task and the main "Logs" tab for any error messages. Ensure the task is enabled and has a valid schedule.
- **Interface is not translated:** Make sure the corresponding language file (e.g., `zh-CN.json`) exists in the `i18n` directory and is correctly formatted.
